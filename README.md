# TELECOM-CHURN-CASE-STUDY

**Problem Statement**
In the telecom industry, customers can switch between service providers, leading to an annual churn rate of 15-25%. Given the high cost of acquiring new customers, retention is vital.

**Business Objective**
The objective is to predict churn in the ninth month using data from the first three months. Understanding customer behavior during churn is key.

**Business Recommendations**
Target customers with low usage of incoming local calls and outgoing ISD calls, particularly in August.
Focus on customers with reduced charges for other services in July and August.
Identify customers with increased value-based costs in the action phase.
